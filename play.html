<p>Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?</p>
<h6 class="name LANE">LANE.</h6>
<p>I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.</p>
<h6>ALGERNON.</h6>
<p>I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—any one can
play accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the
piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.</p>
<h6 class="name LANE">LANE.</h6>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<h6>ALGERNON.</h6>
<p>And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber
sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?</p>
<h6 class="name LANE">LANE.</h6>
<p>Yes, sir.</p> 
<p>[Hands them on a salver.]</p>
<h6>ALGERNON.</h6>
<p>[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.]</p> 
<p>Oh! . . . by the
way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord
Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of
champagne are entered as having been consumed.</p>
<h6 class="name LANE">LANE.</h6>
<p>Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.</p>
<h6>ALGERNON.</h6>
<p>Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably
drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.</p>
<h6 class="name LANE">LANE.</h6>
<p>I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often
observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a
first-rate brand.</p>
<h6>ALGERNON.</h6>
<p>Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?</p>
<h6 class="name LANE">LANE.</h6>
<p>I believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little
experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married
once. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and
a young person.</p>
<h6>ALGERNON.</h6>
<p>[Languidly_._] </p>
<p>I don’t know that I am much interested in your family
life, Lane.</p>
<h6 class="name LANE">LANE.</h6>
<p>No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it
myself.</p>
<h6>ALGERNON.</h6>
<p>Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.</p>
<h6 class="name LANE">LANE.</h6>
<p>Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>[Lane goes out.]</p>
<h6>ALGERNON.</h6>
<p>Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders
don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They
seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.</p>
